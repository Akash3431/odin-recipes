# odin-recipes
This project is part of The Odin Project course. It helped me utilize and understand boilerplate HTML and use basic HTML tags like <a>, <img>, <ul>, <ol>, etc. The home webpage has links to associated webpages. Each associated webpage shows an image of a certain food and the associated recipe for it.
